# Shotobump Setup Notes

## Current Status âœ…

The app is now **running successfully** with the following components:

### âœ… Working Features
- **Beautiful UI**: Login screen and Home screen with gradients and animations
- **Navigation**: React Navigation setup with authentication flow
- **Mock Authentication**: Temporary mock Spotify auth to bypass package issues
- **Database Schema**: Complete Supabase schema ready to deploy
- **Project Structure**: Well-organized codebase with TypeScript

### âœ… Real Spotify Authentication
- **Spotify Auth**: Now supports real OAuth with dual redirect URIs
- **Web Development**: Uses `127.0.0.1:19006` for local testing
- **Mobile/Production**: Uses `shotobump://auth` custom scheme

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Set Up Your Services (Required)

#### Supabase Setup
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Copy your project URL and anon key from Settings > API
3. In the SQL Editor, run the database schema from README.md

#### Spotify Developer Setup
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Add **BOTH** redirect URIs (this is crucial):
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8081/` (for web development)
   - `shotobump://auth` (for mobile/production)
4. Copy your Client ID

**ðŸ“– Detailed Setup**: See `SPOTIFY_SETUP.md` for step-by-step instructions

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your actual credentials:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
EXPO_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-spotify-client-id
```

### 3. Test Real Spotify Authentication

The app now supports real Spotify authentication:

```bash
npm start
# Press 'w' for web browser - uses 127.0.0.1:8081 redirect
# Press 'i' for iOS simulator - uses custom scheme redirect
```

**Important**: Make sure you added BOTH redirect URIs to your Spotify app!

### 4. Test the App

```bash
npm start
# Press 'i' for iOS simulator
# Press 'w' for web browser
```

## What You Can Do Right Now

With real Spotify authentication working, you can:
- âœ… See the beautiful login screen
- âœ… Sign in with your real Spotify account
- âœ… See your real Spotify profile and avatar
- âœ… Create and join rooms with real user data
- âœ… Navigate through the complete app flow
- âœ… Test on both web and mobile platforms

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 3: Room Management (Next)
- Implement real room creation API calls
- Add room joining functionality
- Real-time room state with Supabase Realtime

### Milestone 4: Song Stack Management
- Spotify search integration (once auth is fixed)
- Add/remove songs from personal stacks
- Display song libraries

### Milestone 5: Game Engine
- Turn-based gameplay logic
- Timer system
- Real-time game state synchronization

### Milestone 6: Scoring & Voting
- Guess submission and validation
- Voting system for answer acceptance
- Score tracking and leaderboards

## Troubleshooting

### If the app won't start:
1. Make sure you're in the Shotobump directory
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Check that your `.env` file exists (even with placeholder values)

### If you see authentication errors:
- The mock auth should work for now
- Real Spotify auth will be restored once the package issue is resolved

### If you see database errors:
- Make sure you've set up your Supabase project
- Run the database schema from the README
- Check your environment variables
